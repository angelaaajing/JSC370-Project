# Explore the Relationship between Prevalence of Mental Disorder and Various Factors (Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Other Health Outcomes)

## Project Motivation & Description 

The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a vital source of information on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States. It is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). With its comprehensive coverage of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, it provides an excellent platform for investigating the correlates of prevalent mental health disorders among adults, such as anxiety and depression. This study aims to Explore the Relationship between Prevalence of Mental Disorder and Various Factors (Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Other Health Outcomes). Understanding these correlations can provide valuable insights into the determinants of mental health and inform public health policies and interventions.

The NHIS dataset for the year 2022 was acquired from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website by directly downloading the CSV file, which is usually considered to be an reliable and original source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2022nhis.htm
